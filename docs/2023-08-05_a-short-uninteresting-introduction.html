<p>Hello, my name is David, and
I've had a very windy career path in the tech world.</p>
<p>I started out as a postman that was destined to be a car mechanic, following in my father's footsteps.</p>
<p>IT had always interested me when I was young. So I went to college to study computer science, and I've been working in
the tech industry ever since.
I started my own business at an early age, which wasn't the best idea, but I learned a lot from it.</p>
<p>In my early career, I was doing both web development and IT support jobs. I would work for myself and others until
I found a permanent role at a local company managing ecommerce websites.</p>
<p>From there I moved further into the IT support world, moving around a few companies doing
vastly different levels of support and repairs. Over the years, I've worked on the microscopic; trace
repairs on motherboards to phone repairs all the way up to
the macroscopic; network infrastructure deployments to hypervisors.</p>
<p>My education was in software though. The support and repair world may have dragged me in, but I never stopped coding.</p>
<p>My first languages were web-based. Starting with the obvious, HTML and CSS. Touching on PHP,
didn't like it, so I learned the next worst thing, Coldfusion.</p>
<p>Using a combination of Coldfusion and Javascript, I built a few websites for myself and others. Ending
up with around 12 local businesses using my services.</p>
<p>My coding main quest was pretty slow during my aforementioned support career path. I was loosely learning
bits of Python, javascript, and drips of things like bash and lua. My education taught me C++
and Visual Basic. Visual Basic 6... which was deprecated just as I finished
my education, and who is able to retain any C++ when you don't use it every day?</p>
<p>Anyway, fast-forward to the present day. I'm now a full time
software developer/engineer/(whatever the kids are calling it these days) working within the insolvency sector.</p>
<p>We use mostly Flask in our stack, which is not the worst thing in the world. I've grown to really love python,
and I'm glad I've been able to use it in my career. Since working here, the only other language I've used is Dart.
Boss man said he wanted a phone app, and Flutter was chosen. I don't think I'll use Dart for anything other than
Flutter.</p>
<p>Yeah - so here we are, at the end of probably the worst blog post you've ever read. Oh, the purpose of this blog!</p>
<p>I'm going to be using this blog to document my journey through the world of software development. I plan to put anything
interesting I learn here, no matter how foolish it is. I have plans to document a journey of learning and developing.</p>
<p>The Next post will be what I'm using to build this site. I think you might like it; it's pretty cool. I also plan to
learn
as many languages as I can, and I'll be documenting that here too.</p>
