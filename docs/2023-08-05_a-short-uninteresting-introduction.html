<h2 style="font-size: 2.6rem; margin: 0;">A Short Uninteresting Introduction</h2>


<p>Hello, my name is David, and I've had a very windy career path in the tech world.</p>
<p>Computers had always interested me when I was young, I have memories of playing a speedboat spelling
game on a BBC micro in primary school (I guess this would be an elementary school in the US).</p>
<p>I got my first computer when I was around 16, a year 2000 iMac with the see-through back
and dial-up AOL internet, good times. I would spend hours on that thing, playing games and messing around.</p>
<p>My grandfather was really into computers then too, specifically Macs. He also loved photography, and I ended up
with a copy of his Photoshop 7. Many hours were spent messing around with that. During this time, the internet was
getting huge, and using html was one of the things you just did on the internet at that time. Building websites
out of tables haha.</p>
<p>My first real job was a postman (or mailman / mail carrier if you're from the US).
However, I was destined to be a car mechanic, following in my father's footsteps.
I would sometimes help out in the garage, changing tyres and things.</p>
<p>It came to winter one year when I was helping out in the garage, and the constant cold and wet changed my mind about
being a mechanic. I decided I wanted to work in an office, where it was warm and dry.</p>
<p>So I went to college to study computing hardware and software. I also managed to do a business
course around this time as well.</p>
<p>After college, I started my own business at too young of an age. Which wasn't the
best idea, but learned a lot from it. I'd provide both web development, IT support and repair.
Running a business is hard work, and I wasn't ready for it then.</p>
<p>From there I moved further into the IT support world, moving around a few companies doing
vastly different levels of support and repairs.</p>
<p>During the IT support years, I worked on the microscopic; Trace repairs on motherboards to phone repairs all the way up to
the macroscopic; Network infrastructure deployments, laying cat 5, to being involved in setting up hypervisors.</p>
<p>My education was mostly in software though. The support and repair world may have dragged me in,
but I never stopped coding.</p>
<p>My first languages were web-based. Starting with the obvious, HTML and CSS. Touching on PHP,
didn't like it, so I learned the next worst thing, Coldfusion.</p>
<p>Using a combination of Coldfusion and Javascript, I built a few websites for myself and others. Ending
up with around 12 local businesses.</p>
<p>My coding main quest was pretty slow during my aforementioned support career path. I was loosely learning
bits of Python, javascript, and drips of things like lua. My education taught me C++
and Visual Basic. Visual Basic 6... which was deprecated just as I finished
my education, and who is able to retain any C++ when you don't use it every day?</p>
<p>Anyway, fast-forward to the present day. I'm now a full time
software developer/engineer/(whatever the kids are calling it these days) working within the financial technology sector.</p>
<p>I mostly use Flask, which I've grown to love. I've grown to really love Python in general, and I'm glad I've
been able to use it in my career.</p>
<p>I've touched on other languages like Dart for a phone app project. Using the Flutter framework, which was pretty cool.</p>
<p>Yeah - so here we are, at the end of probably the worst blog post you've ever read. Oh, the purpose of this blog!</p>
<p>I'm going to be using this blog to document my journey through the world of software development. I plan to put anything
interesting I learn here, no matter how foolish it is. I have plans to document a journey of learning and developing.</p>
<p>The Next post will be what I'm using to build this site. I think you might like it; it's pretty cool. I also plan to
learn as many languages as I can, and I'll be documenting that here too.</p>
