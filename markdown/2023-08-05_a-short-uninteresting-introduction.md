Hello, my name is David, and I've had a very winding career path in the tech world.

Computers have always interested me since I was young. I have memories of playing a speedboat spelling game on a BBC
micro in primary school (I guess this would be elementary school in the US).

I got my first computer when I was around 16, a year 2000 iMac with the see-through back and dial-up AOL internet â€” good
times. I would spend hours on that thing, playing games and messing around.

My grandfather was really into computers then too, specifically Macs. He also loved photography, and I ended up with a
copy of his Photoshop 7. Many hours were spent messing around with that. During this time, the internet was expanding
rapidly, and using HTML was one of the things you just did on the internet at that time. Building websites out of
tables, haha.

My first real job was as a postman (or mailman/mail carrier if you're from the US). However, I was destined to be a car
mechanic, following in my father's footsteps. I would sometimes help out in the garage, changing tires and such.

One winter, while helping out in the garage, the constant cold and wet changed my mind about being a mechanic. I decided
I wanted to work in an office, where it was warm and dry.

So, I went to college to study computing hardware and software. I also managed to do a business course around this time
as well.

After college, I started my own business at too young of an age, which wasn't the best idea, but I learned a lot from
it. I provided both web development and IT support and repair. Running a business is hard work, and I wasn't ready for
it then.

From there, I moved further into the IT support world, working at a few companies doing vastly different levels of
support and repairs.

During my years in IT support, I worked on tasks ranging from microscopic trace repairs on motherboards to phone
repairs, all the way up to macroscopic network infrastructure deployments, laying Cat 5, and being involved in setting
up hypervisors.

Although my education was mostly in software, the support and repair world pulled me in, but I never stopped coding.

My first languages were web-based, starting with the obvious HTML and CSS. I dabbled in PHP but didn't like it, so I
learned the next worst thing, Coldfusion.

Using a combination of Coldfusion and JavaScript, I built a few websites for myself and others, ending up with around 12
local businesses.

My coding journey progressed slowly during my aforementioned support career path. I loosely learned bits of Python,
JavaScript, and drips of languages like Lua. My education also taught me C++ and Visual Basic, including the
now-deprecated Visual Basic 6. It's hard to retain any C++ when you don't use it every day, right?

Anyway, fast-forward to the present day. I'm now a full-time software developer/engineer/(whatever the kids are calling
it these days), working within the financial technology sector.

I mostly use Flask, which I've grown to love. I've also grown to really love Python in general, and I'm glad I've been
able to use it in my career.

I've touched on other languages like Dart for a phone app project, using the Flutter framework, which was pretty cool.

Yeah, so here we are, at the end of probably the worst blog post you've ever read. Oh, the purpose of this blog!

I'm going to be using this blog to document my journey through the world of software development. I plan to share
anything interesting I learn here, no matter how foolish it may seem. I have plans to document a journey of learning and
developing.

The next post will be about what I'm using to build this site. I think you might like it; it's pretty cool. I also plan
to learn as many languages as I can and will be documenting that here too.
